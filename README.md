Week 4 weekend challange for Makers Academy

# Shore

Imagine standing on a beach and a wave washes up a message in a bottle. It could be from a neighbour
or from someone the other side of the world. It could be a joke, a pearl of wisdom or a shopping list.  
One thing is certain, the pure excitement of opening the message remains the same.  
Open shore and visit your personal beach to read messages or cast out your own bottle and see where 
the currents take it.
